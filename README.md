## Prerequisites

Install [Docker Desktop](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker) for Mac, Windows, or Linux. Docker Desktop includes Docker Compose as part of the installation.

## Development

First, run the development server:

```bash
# Create a network, which allows containers to communicate
# with each other, by using their container name as a hostname
docker network create face-2-simpson-network

# Build dev
docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml build

# Up dev
docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Production

Multistage builds are highly recommended in production. Combined with the Next [Output Standalone](https://nextjs.org/docs/advanced-features/output-file-tracing#automatically-copying-traced-files) feature, only `node_modules` files required for production are copied into the final Docker image.

First, run the production server (Final image approximately 110 MB).

```bash
# Create a network, which allows containers to communicate
# with each other, by using their container name as a hostname
docker network create face-2-simpson-network

# Build prod
docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml build

# Up prod in detached mode
docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d
```

Alternatively, run the production server without without multistage builds (Final image approximately 1 GB).

```bash
# Create a network, which allows containers to communicate
# with each other, by using their container name as a hostname
docker network create face-2-simpson-network

# Build prod without multistage
docker compose -f docker-compose.prod-without-multistage.yml build

# Up prod without multistage in detached mode
docker compose -f docker-compose.prod-without-multistage.yml up -d
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

## Useful commands

```bash
# Stop all running containers
docker kill $(docker ps -aq) && docker rm $(docker ps -aq)

# Free space
docker system prune -af --volumes
```
